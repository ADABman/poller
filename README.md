# Sonar Poller

![Sonar Poller](screenshot.png)

## Introduction

This poller provides a way to collect data from your network and return it to Sonar. This poller only works with Sonar v2 - please check out the [legacy poller](https://github.com/sonarsoftwareinc/poller-v1) if you're on Sonar version 1.

## Installation

Feel free to reach out to Sonar support if you need assistance getting the poller up and running.

The poller is designed to run on [Ubuntu 20 Server Edition](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.1/ubuntu-20.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso). Install on bare metal or a VM, and then follow the steps below.

1. From the command line, enter `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SonarSoftwareInc/poller/master/setup.sh`
2. Enter `chmod +x setup.sh`
3. Enter `sudo ./setup.sh`

The poller should automatically install and get up and running. Once this is complete, you can access the poller web interface by navigating to `https://SERVER_IP` in a browser, where `SERVER_IP` is the IP address of the server you installed the poller on.

Login using your Sonar credentials, navigate to the `Settings` tab and enter the necessary information. To receive a poller API key, you'll need to add the poller into Sonar under **Settings > Monitoring > Pollers**. Now navigate to the `Device Credentials` tab and enter any applicable credentials.

## For developers
### Adding new types of devices

Edit `config/devices.json` and add a response value which should be the response to an SNMP get to `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0`. Add a device value which is a string representing the entire namespace and class name of the mapper in question.

If the class name is a mapper inside `src/DeviceMappers`, then the mapper must extend `BaseDeviceMapper`. If the class name is an identifier inside `src/DeviceIdentifiers`, then the identifier must implement `IdentifierInterface`. Almost all responses should be a mapper - the identifier path is only needed if the vendor doesn't uniquely identify their devices by a response to `1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0`.

Check out an existing mapper for examples of the best way to implement a new one. The Netonix/Ws6Mini, Ubiquiti/Toughswitch or MikroTik/MikroTik mappers have examples of using non-SNMP based data collection as well.


## Basic CLI Operation
### Starting/Stopping the poller service

Run `supervisorctl restart sonar_poller` to restart the poller

Run `supervisorctl stop sonar_poller` to stop the poller

### Enabling Debug Mode

You will need to set the environment variable `SONAR_DEBUG_MODE`, setting it to 1 will enable debugging, and setting it to 0 will disable debugging.

Run `export SONAR_DEBUG_MODE=1` to enable debugging

Run `export SONAR_DEBUG_MODE=0` to disable debugging

Restart the poller (see the supervisorctl commands above) to enable the changes to take effect
